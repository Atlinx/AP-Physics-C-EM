# Resistors

Resistors are circuit elements that oppose the flow of charge.

**Resistance** ($R$ : Scalar | $\Omega$) - The amount of opposition to the circuit flow.

**Ohms** ($\Omega$) - A measurement of resistance.

A resistor can be added in series onto other elements to represent internal resistance, since in the real world, everything has a little bit of resistance â€” including wires. 

## Series and Parallel Resistors

### Series

$$
\large
\begin{aligned}

R_\text{eq} &= R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + \ldots \\\\

\end{aligned}
$$

### Parallel

$$
\large
\begin{aligned}

R_\text{eq} &= \left(\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3} + \ldots \right)^{-1} \\\\

\end{aligned}
