# Superposition Principle

Superposition is a property that states the net response caused by two or more stimuli is the sum of the responses that would have been caused by each stimuli simultaneously.

For example, given some property P that is depend on position, the net $P$ at a given position is the sum of all the individual $P$ at that position.

P_{net}(x, y) &= P_1(x, y) + P_2(x, y) \\
&+ P_3(x, y) + P_4(x, y) \\
&+ \ldots \\
\end{aligned}
