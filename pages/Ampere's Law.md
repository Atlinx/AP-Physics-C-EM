# Ampere's Law

Ampere's Law connects the B-field along a closed loop with the current enclosed by the loop

The closed loop that you integrate around is called an **"Amperian Path"** or an **"Amperian Loop."** This is similar to "**Gaussian Surfaces**" in [[Gauss's Law]] except an Amperian loop is a line that connects back to itself, while Gaussian surfaces are closed 3-D shapes.

The formula for Ampere's Law is

$$\Huge \oint \vec B \cdot d \vec s = \mu_0 I_\text{enc}$$

> **LEGEND:**
> $\oint$ - This unique integral symbol indicates that we are integrating over a closed path.
> 
> $\vec B$ - The magnetic field at a point on the amperian path.
> 
> $d \vec s$ - A small change in length on a point on the loop.
> 
> $\mu_0$ - The permeability of free space. This is a constant that is $\approx 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \frac{Tm}{A}$. 
> > **NOTE:**
> > Make sure to not confuse this with the permetivity of free space, which is a constant relating to [[Electric Fields]].
> 
> $I_{enc}$ - The net amount of current that is enclosed by the Amperian loop.

## Right-Hand Rule

To figure out which current's point in the "positive" direction and which currents point in the "negative" direction when calculating $I_enc$, we can use a right-hand rule.

 Curl your fingers around the direction of the path of integration. Then point your thumb straight up. Your thumb will be pointing the direction of positive currents.
