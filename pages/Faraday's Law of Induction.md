# Faraday's Law of Induction

The magnitude of the emf in a conducting loop is equal to the rate at which the magnetic flux through the loop varies over time.

$$\Huge \mathcal{E} = -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}$$

> **LEGEND:**
> $\Phi_B$ - The magnetic flux through the loop.
> $\mathcal{E}$ - The magnitude of the emf in the loop.

> **NOTE:**
> The negative in the formula means that the emf is pointing in such a way that it induced a current which will induce a B-field to oppose the change in magnetic flux. This negative is probably best explained by [[Lenz's Law]].

If a tightly-packed coil is experiences a change in magnetic flux through it's loops, then

$$\Huge \mathcal{E} = -N\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}$$

> **LEGEND:**
> $\Phi_B$ - The magnetic flux through the loop.
> $\mathcal{E}$ - The magnitude of the emf in the loop.
> $N$ - The number of loops in the coil.

A change in magnetic flux can happen due to a change in the B-field passing through the area, a change in the size of the area, a change in the angle between the B-field and the area, or a combination of previous stated possibilities.

## Induced Electric Fields

A changing magnetic flux generates an electric field.

**Induced Electric Field** - An electric field created by a changing magnetic field.

The equation for an induced E-field can be derived from Faraday's Law of Induction. Therefore as another way to write this law,

$$\Huge \oint \vec E \cdot d \vec s = -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}$$

> **NOTE:**
> This integral is on a closed loop

Induced electric field are nonconservative because they do work along a closed path.

### Electric Potential In Induced E-Fields

Induced electric field lines are loops, whereas normal field lines for E-fields surround static charges start and end at a point.

Therefore electric potential only has meaning for E-fields produced by static charges. Induced E-fields do not have electric potential.

> **Ex.**
> Consider a charge particle that starts at a position on an electric-field line of an induced E-field. This particle will move along the loop and reach it's original position. You would expect the starting position to be of higher potential than it's ending position, but since the ending position is the exact same position as the starting position, there electric potential has no meaning for induced E-fields.
