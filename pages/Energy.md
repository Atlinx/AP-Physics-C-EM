# Energy

There are different types of energy in the world. Energy is the capacity for doing work. 

Energy can be transferred from one type to another, such as the potential energy of a object on a cliff transferring to kinetic energy as the object falls off the cliff.

Energy is a scalar quantity and is measured in joules.

**Joule** ($J$) - A unit of energy.

## Potential Energy

Potential energy is a whole subset of energy which is categorized as energy stored by in an object by virtue of the object's position, or other intrinsic property.

#### [[Electric Potential Energy]]

## Kinetic Energy

**Kinetic Energy** ($K$ : Scalar | $J$)

Energy of a object by virtue of it's movement

This form of energy is studied mostly in mechanics.

$$\Huge K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$

> **LEGEND:**
> $m$ - Mass of the moving object.
> $v$ - Velocity of the moving object.

## Power

**Power** ($P$ : Scalar | $W$, $\frac{J}{s}$) - The rate at which work is done or the rate at which energy is transferred from one form to another.

**Watt** ($W$) - A unit of power.

\begin{aligned}
P &= I^2R \\
P &= Fv \\

> **NOTE:**
> $P = Fv$ is derived from the work equation of $W = F \Delta x$ by dividing both sides by $\Delta t$.
