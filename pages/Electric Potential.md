# Electric Potential

Electric potential is a property for a position near charges. The electric potential at a given position is the electric potential energy that a positive test charge would have if placed at that position.

**Electric Potential** ($\phi$ : Scalar | $J$)

$$\Huge \phi = \frac{kq}{r}$$

Electric potential follows the [[Superposition Principle]]. That is, the net electric potential at a given position is equal to the electric potential caused by each individual charge.
