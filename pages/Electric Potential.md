# Electric Potential

Electric potential is a property for a position near charges. The electric potential at a given position is the electric potential energy that a positive test charge would have if placed at that position.

**Volts** ($V$) - A unit of emf.

**Electric Potential** ($\phi$ : Scalar | $V$)

$$\Huge \phi = \frac{kq}{r}$$

Electric potential follows the [[Superposition Principle]]. That is, the net electric potential at a given position is equal to the electric potential caused by each individual charge.

**Voltage** ($\Delta \phi$, $V$ : Scalar | $V$) - The difference in electric potential between two points.
