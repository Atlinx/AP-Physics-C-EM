# Electric Potential

Electric potential is a property for a position near charges. The electric potential at a given position is the electric potential energy that a positive test charge would have if placed at that position.

**Volts** ($V$) - A unit of emf.

**Electric Potential** ($\phi, V$ : Scalar | $V$)

$$\Huge \phi = \frac{kq}{r}$$

Electric potential follows the [[Superposition Principle]]. That is, the net electric potential at a given position is equal to the electric potential caused by each individual charge.

**Voltage** ($\Delta \phi$, $V$ : Scalar | $V$) - The difference in electric potential between two points.

The relationship between electric potential and electric field strength is

$$

\begin{aligned}
V &= -Ed \\
E &= -\frac{dV}{dx} \\
\end{aligned}
$$
> **LEGEND:**
> $V$ - Electric potential
> $E$ - E-field

> **NOTE:**
> The negative sign signifies that E-fields point from high potential to low potential.
> 
> This means if you experience an increase in V after moving a certain distance, which results in $+\frac{dV}{dx}$, then the E-field must point backwards, which results in $-\frac{dV}{dx}$.

## Partial Derivatives
If given an equation for V that depends on position, you can find the E-field at any postion by taking partial derivatives of the E-field for each position axis.

This gives you the individuals components of the E-field in each axis.

When you take a partial derivative of an equation with respect to a given variable $x$, you treat any variable other than $x$ as a constant. Partial derivatives also use the symbol $\partial$ instead of $d$ in Leibniz notation.

E_x &= \frac{\partial V}{\partial x} = 4x\\
E_y &= \frac{\partial V}{\partial y} = -6y\\
