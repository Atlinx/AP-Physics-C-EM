# Eddy Currents

Current that swirls in loops inside of a conductor when the conductor experiences a change in magnetic flux. These currents are named after the eddies and whirlpools that occur naturally in rivers, because they are "whirpool-like" loops of current.

Eddy currents will follow [[Lenz's Law]] and point in a direction that generates a B-field that opposes the change in magnetic flux.
