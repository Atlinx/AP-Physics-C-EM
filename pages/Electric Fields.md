# Electric Fields

Every charged object has an electric field that permeates the space around it. This electric field determines the force exerted on a charge that is placed somewhere in the field.

Electric fields are commonly represented by **vector fields**, which are a grid (or box if 3-D) of points that each have a vector associated with it. In the case of electric fields, each points' vector is based on the **electric field strength** at each points' position.

**Electric Field Strength** (Vector | $\frac{N}{C}$, $\frac{V}{m}$) - A vector at a given point in space that determines the direction and amount of force a positively charged particle would feel. Negative charges would experience the same force in the opposite direction.

**Electric Field Lines** - Electric vector fields are commonly simplified into electric field lines, which are lines that connect vectors that are pointing in similar directions. Each line traces out a path that a positive test charge would take if placed on that line.

**Electric Field Strength** ($E$ : Vector | $\frac{N}{C}$)

$$\Huge E = \frac{kq}{r^2}$$

Electric field strength follows the [[Superposition Principle]]. That is, the net electric field strength at a given position is equal to the electric field strength caused by each individual charge.
