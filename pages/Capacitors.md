# Capacitors

Capacitors are a circuit element that can hold charge. They act as temporary batteries that can be charged or discharged.

**Capacitance** ($C$ : Scalar | $F$) - A measure of how much charge a capacitor can hold.

**Farads** ($F$) - The unit for capacitance.

Capacitors...

- have a capacitance denoted by $C$.
- have a voltage drop across itself denoted by $V$.
- have a current through itself denoted by $I$.
- hold an amount of charge denoted by $Q$ and measured in coloumbs.

## Parallel Plate Capacitors

The most common kind of capacitor is a parallel plate capacitor. These capacitors are made of two parallel plates with a gap in the middle. These capacitors create a difference in potential when charged by gathering $-$ charge on onside and $+$ charge on the other side.

The circuit symbol for a capacitor comes from the shape of parallel plate capacitors, with two separated lines representing the two plates.

## Series and Parallel Capacitors

### Series

$$
\large
\begin{aligned}

C_\text{eq} &= \left(\frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2} + \frac{1}{C_3} + \ldots \right)^{-1} \\\\

Q_\text{eq} &= Q_1 = Q_2 = Q_3 = \ldots \\

\end{aligned}
$$

### Parallel

$$
\large
\begin{aligned}

C_\text{eq} &= C_1 + C_2 + C_3 + \ldots \\\\

Q_\text{eq} &= Q_1 + Q_2 + Q_3 + \ldots \\

\end{aligned}
$$

> **NOTE:**
> Charges add up for a capacitors in parallel because the all the parallel plates on one side combined to make a giant plate on that side. 
> 
> With the giant parallels on either side, we now have the combined charge capacity of all the indivudal capacitors.
