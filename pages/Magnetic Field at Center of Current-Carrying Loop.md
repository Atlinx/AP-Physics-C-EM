# Magnetic Field at Center of Current-Carrying Loop

Using the [[Bio-Savart Law]], we can derive the magnetic field at the center of a current-carrying loop.

This turns out to be

$$\huge B = \frac{\mu_0 I y^2}{2(y^2 + x^2)^\frac{3}{2}}$$


> **LEGEND:**
> $\mu_0$ - Permeability of free space constant.
> $I$ - Current through the loop.
> $y$ - Radius of the loop (See diagram).
> $x$ - Distance from the center of the loop (See diagram).

At the complete center of the loop, the experssion above simplifies down to

$$
\huge
\begin{aligned}
B &= \frac{\mu_0 I y^2}{2y^3} \\
&= \frac{\mu_0 I}{2y} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

> **NOTE:**
> You cannot use [[Ampere's Law]] to find the B-field at the center of a current-carrying loop since a circular Amperian path at the center would not enclose any current at all.

## Partial Loop

If a current-carrying loop is just an arc, the magnetic field at the complete center would equal the magnetic field at the center of a complete loop times the arc's angle out of the total angle of a circle.

$$\huge B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2y} \cdot \frac{\theta}{2\pi}$$

> **LEGEND:**
> $\theta$ - Angle of the arc in radians
