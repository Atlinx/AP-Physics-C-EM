# Lenz's Law

An current induced by a change in magnetic flux will point in a direction such that it's own B-field opposes the change in magnetic flux.

If we use a loop of wire, the induced current basically wants to preseve the same flux through the loop, therefore it must point in direction such that the B-field opposes the change in magnetic flux (which is the loop's attempt to preserve the flux inside the wire).

## Right-Hand Rule

To figure out the direction of a current as stated in Lenz's Law for a conducting loop, we can use a right-hand rule.

Make a thumbs-up sign. Then point your thumb opposite to the direction of the change in magnetic flux. Your fingers will curl around in the direction of the current.
