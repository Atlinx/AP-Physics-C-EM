# Electric Force

Charged particles exert a force on each proportional to the charge of both particles. The direction of the force is determined by the sign of the two particles' charges.

> **Opposite** signed charges **attract**.
>   
> - Positive & negative
>  
> **Same** signed charges  **repel**.

> - Negative & negative 

Electric Force ($F_E$ : Vector | $N$)

$$\Huge F_E = \frac{kQq}{r^2}$$

> **NOTE:**
> The sign of $F_E$ determines the direction that both particles will move in.
> 
> $+$ means the particles will move away from each other
> 
> $-$ means the particles will move towards each other
