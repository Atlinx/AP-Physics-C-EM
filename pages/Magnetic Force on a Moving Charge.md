# Magnetic Force on a Moving Charge

A magnetic field not only attracts other magnets, but also affects moving charges inside the field.

The magnetic force does **no work** on a moving charge since it always points perpendicular to displacement of the charge and if you recall, $W=F \Delta x$.

> **NOTE:**
> AP Physics C: E&M does not cover magnetic force between two magnets &mdash; it only covers magnetic force on a moving charge. 

Given a moving particle with a charge of $q$ and a velocity of $v$, and where $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec v$ and $\vec B$, then

$$
\Large
\begin{aligned}
& F_B = q\vec v \times \vec B \\
& F_B = qv B \sin\theta \\
\end{aligned}
$$

## Right-Hand Rule

To determine the direction of $\vec B$, $\vec v$, and $F_B$, we use the right hand rule. Using your right hand, your middle finger points in  $\vec B$, your index finger points in $\vec v$, and your thumb points in $F$. 

You can use the mnemonic "BUFF" to memorize the order of the terms, which is $BvF$, starting on the middle finger and going to the right.

>**NOTE:**
> This right-hand rule gives the direction for a **positive** particle.
> 
> If you are dealing with negative particles like electrons, you would have to first find the vector of interest using the right-hand rule and then reverse the direction of that vector.

## Circular Motion

A charged particle moving with constant velocity inside a uniform B-field will experience circular motion, since $F_B$ is always perpendicular to movement of the particle. 

Therefore in the situation,

$$\Large F_B = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$
