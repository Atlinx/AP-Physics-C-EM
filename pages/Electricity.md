# Electricity

Electricity is a form of energy resulting from the existence of charged particles.

The charge of a particle is determined at the atomic level, where a particle's electrons contribute negative charge while the particle's protons contribute postivie charge. 

> **NOTE:**
> "Charge" is also short for a charged object

Protons and electrons have the **same magnitude** of charge but have different signs (electrons are $-$ and protons are $+$ charged.)

> If a particle has more protons than electrons, then the particle is **positvely charged**.
>
> If a particle has more electrons than protons, then the particle is **negatively charged**.

**Coloumb** ($C$) - An SI unit for electric charge. A particle's charge is measured in coloumbs.

**Test Charge** - A charge with an extremely small magnitude that is used to measure or "test" the the electric field strength at a position. Test charges are postive by convention.
