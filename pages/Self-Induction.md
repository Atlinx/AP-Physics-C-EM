# Self Induction

An induced emf $\mathcal{E}_L$ appears in any coil in which the current is changing. 

**Self Induction** - The creation of an emf when the current through a circuit element is changed. This mainly applies to inductors. 

**Self-Induced Emf** ($\mathcal{E}_L$) - Also know as "back emf," this is the emf induced by a changing current that affects the circuit element.

The formula for self-induced emf is,

$$\Huge \mathcal{E}_L = -L \cdot \frac{di}{dt}$$

> **LEGEND:**
> $L$ - Inductance of the inductor.
> $\dfrac{di}{dt}$ - Change in current over time of the inductor.
> 
> Is negative to signify that the direction of $\mathcal{E}_L$ opposes the change in current through the inductor. This direction can be found using [[Lenz's Law]].
