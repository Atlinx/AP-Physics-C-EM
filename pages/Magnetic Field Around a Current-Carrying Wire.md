# Magnetic Field Around a Current-Carrying Wire

A current-carrying wire generates a magnetic field around itself. The strength of this B-field is

$$\Large B=\frac{\mu_0 I_\text{enc}}{2 \pi r}$$

This is can be derived using [[Ampere's Law]].

## Right-Hand Rule

The direction of the B-field around a current-carrying wire can be found using a right-hand rule.

Make a thumbs up sign and then point your thumb in the direction of the current. Your fingers will curl around in the direction of the B-field around the wire.
