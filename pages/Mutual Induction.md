# Mutual Induction

When a coil with a changing current generates a B-field that induces a current another coil that's nearby.

Given the following diagram,

![](attachments/mutual_induction.png)

The mutual inductance of coil 2 is with respect to coil 1 is

$$\Large M = M_\text{2 to 1} = \frac{N_2 \Phi_\text{2 to 1}}{i_1}$$

> **NOTE:**
> $M_\text{2 to 1} = M_\text{1 to 2} = M$

The emf of coil 2 generated coil 1 would be

$$\Large \mathcal{E}_2 = - M \frac{di_1}{dt}$$
