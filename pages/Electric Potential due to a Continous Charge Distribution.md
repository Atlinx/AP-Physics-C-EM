# Electric Potential due to a Continous Charge Distribution
Derived from the electric potential formula, the change in electric potential is

$$
\Large
\begin{aligned}
dV &= d \left( \frac{kq}{r} \right) \\
&= \frac{k \cdot dq}{r} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore the net electric potential at a point is

$$\Large V_\text{net} = \int \frac{k}{r} \cdot dq$$
