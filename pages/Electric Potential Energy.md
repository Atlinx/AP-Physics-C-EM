# Electric Potential Energy

Two or more charges have potential energy due to their position relative to each other.

Opposite signed charges that are close together have high potential energy than opposite signed charges that are far apart, since opposite signed charges repel on another.

Same signed charges that are far apart have higher potential energy than same signed charges that are close together, since same signed charges attract each other.

**Electric Potential Energy** ($U_E$ : Scalar | $J$)

$$\Huge U_E = \frac{kQq}{r}$$

> **NOTE:**
> Potential energy is energy stored due to a relationship between two objects (whether it be chemical properties, or physical position of the objects). 
> 
> Therefore electric potential energy can only exist for two or more charges &mdash; a single charge does **not have any potential energy**.

Electric potential energy for a given particle follows the [[Superposition Principle]]. That is the net potential energy of a system of charges is equal to the sum of the potential energies from all individual pairs of charges.
