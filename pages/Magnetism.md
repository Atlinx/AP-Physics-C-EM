## Magnets

Magnets arise on the microscopic level from spinning electrons. In non-magnetic materials, the spin of the electrons are oriented randomly, which means most magnetic fields generated by the spinning electrons cancel out with each other. In magnetic materials, most of the spinning electrons are oriented in the same direction, which gives the entire material a magnetic field. 

**Magnetic Field** - A field that describes the magnetic influence on a moving charge placed at any position in the field. Magnetic fields are commonly called **B-fields**.
